# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Server for AgentMail

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## EARS Compliance

- [x] All functional requirements follow EARS patterns (Ubiquitous/When/While/If-Then/Where)
- [x] Each requirement has explicit system name
- [x] All requirements use active voice
- [x] Each requirement contains only one "shall"
- [x] Numerical values include units (seconds, milliseconds, percent, etc.)
- [x] No vague terms (fast, efficient, user-friendly, robust)
- [x] No escape clauses (if possible, where appropriate)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- EARS patterns used:
  - Ubiquitous: FR-001, FR-002, FR-007, FR-011
  - Event-Driven (When): FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, FR-008, FR-012
  - Unwanted Behavior (If-Then): FR-009, FR-010
